-Practical utility: many people can't purchase an RV, but cultural component of having tipi up
-Tipi itself has to hold liners to double insulate; little kids like to hang on tipi poles!!! People hang their bags on the poles.
-Hot during powwow season- 110! But cold at night
-Look at 2D to start modeling
-Canvas- get 2 big ones off of Amazon, stitch to shape
-Modulate air flow through tipi with holes at the top
-History: people on reservation work on poles; mechanical integrity changes as a structure of time
-Do mechanical testing on this
-Make sure peak can thermally handle fire in middle
-18-19 tipi poles
-1 person can lift a pole alone; but typically 2 people do it
-Either stick to quad or tri, but stand firm!
-Think about diameter of poles: you want a tight canvas
-Thermal stresses, shear stresses, etc.
-Cost: ~$1300 for canvas, ~$200/pole
-last for 40+ years
-not all tipis are the same
	-biggest: ceremonial- could fit a house inside! More oblong- probably 40 ft at widest
	-smaller: 17 ft diameter
	-20 ft typical, 25 ft huge
	-10 ft diameter for small kids + dogs
	-smoking meat: short and squat
	-poles about 5 m, height about 20 ft
-People would probably still like tipi poles even though not authentic, "living culture"
	"If you're going to survive, you have to adapt."-Jordan
	-where anthro-engineering piece comes in
	-already using canvas instead of hides
