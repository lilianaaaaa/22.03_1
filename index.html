</Notes from meeting with Jordan:

Practical utility: many people can't purchase an RV, but cultural component of having tipi up

Tipi itself has to hold liners to double insulate; little kids like to hang on tipi poles!!! People hang their bags on the poles.

Hot during powwow season- 110! But cold at night

Look at 2D to start modeling

Canvas- get 2 big ones off of Amazon, stitch to shape

Modulate air flow through tipi with holes at the top

History: people on reservation work on poles; mechanical integrity changes as a structure of time

Do mechanical testing on this

Make sure peak can thermally handle fire in middle

18-19 tipi poles

1 person can lift a pole alone; but typically 2 people do it

Either stick to quad or tri, but stand firm!

Think about diameter of poles: you want a tight canvas

Thermal stresses, shear stresses, etc.

Cost: ~$1300 for canvas, ~$200/pole

last for 40+ years

not all tipis are the same

biggest: ceremonial- could fit a house inside! More oblong- probably 40 ft at widest
smaller: 17 ft diameter
20 ft typical, 25 ft huge
10 ft diameter for small kids + dogs
smoking meat tipis: short and squat
poles about 5 m, height about 20 ft
People would probably still like tipi poles even though not authentic, "living culture"

"If you're going to survive, you have to adapt."-Jordan
where anthro-engineering piece comes in
already using canvas instead of hides
"cultures are not stagnant lines, nor should they be"
What would final end product be?

proof of concept suggesting there's more to be learned/explored, or one that says otherwise

range of good possibilities

project has life past this semester

give project to kids on reservation>
