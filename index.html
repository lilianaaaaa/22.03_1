Notes from meeting with Jordan: <br>

Practical utility: many people can't purchase an RV, but cultural component of having tipi up <br>

Tipi itself has to hold liners to double insulate; little kids like to hang on tipi poles!!! People hang their bags on the poles.<br>

Hot during powwow season- 110! But cold at night<br>

Look at 2D to start modeling<br>

Canvas- get 2 big ones off of Amazon, stitch to shape<br>

Modulate air flow through tipi with holes at the top<br>

History: people on reservation work on poles; mechanical integrity changes as a structure of time<br>

Do mechanical testing on this<br>

Make sure peak can thermally handle fire in middle<br>

18-19 tipi poles<br>

1 person can lift a pole alone; but typically 2 people do it<br>

Either stick to quad or tri, but stand firm!<br>

Think about diameter of poles: you want a tight canvas<br>

Thermal stresses, shear stresses, etc.<br>

Cost: ~$1300 for canvas, ~$200/pole<br>

last for 40+ years<br>

not all tipis are the same<br>

biggest: ceremonial- could fit a house inside! More oblong- probably 40 ft at widest<br>
smaller: 17 ft diameter<br>
20 ft typical, 25 ft huge<br>
10 ft diameter for small kids + dogs<br>
smoking meat tipis: short and squat<br>
poles about 5 m, height about 20 ft<br>
People would probably still like tipi poles even though not authentic, "living culture"<br>

"If you're going to survive, you have to adapt."-Jordan<br>
where anthro-engineering piece comes in<br>
already using canvas instead of hides<br>
"cultures are not stagnant lines, nor should they be"<br>
What would final end product be?<br>

proof of concept suggesting there's more to be learned/explored, or one that says otherwise<br>

range of good possibilities<br>

project has life past this semester<br>

give project to kids on reservation<br>

  More questions for Jordan: <br>

1. How attractive would pop-up tent be?<br>
